Understood.
I’m going to do this **slowly, carefully, and professionally**, exactly the way a **senior Django architect with 15+ years experience** would design a real-world system. No shortcuts. No feature disorder. No assumptions. Everything will be **aligned, sequential, and stable**.

What follows is a **structured thesis-style roadmap** for building a **Nigeria-ready, API-driven Django e-commerce web application**, from **zero to production**, with **UX as the top priority**, **simple UI**, **high performance**, and **future scalability**.

---

# **THESIS TITLE**

## **Design and Implementation of a High-Performance, API-Driven Django E-Commerce Web Application with User-Centric UX for the Nigerian Market**

---

# **INTRODUCTION (Thesis Context)**

This thesis outlines the systematic design and development of a modern e-commerce web application using Django and Django REST Framework, with MySQL as the primary database and Bootstrap-based HTML/CSS for presentation. The system is engineered with an API-first architecture to ensure future extensibility into mobile applications without backend refactoring. Emphasis is placed on simplicity of user interface, responsiveness, performance optimization, transactional reliability, and comprehensive email communication throughout the user journey.

Establish a clean, scalable, and future-proof foundation for the application before any business logic or UI is introduced.

### **Core Tasks**

1. Initialize Django project with environment separation (development, staging, production).
2. Configure Django REST Framework as the central business logic layer.
3. Set up MySQL database with proper charset, indexing strategy, and connection pooling.
4. Define project folder structure separating:

   * API layer
   * Web/UI layer
   * Core/shared utilities
5. Configure static files, media handling, and Bootstrap asset pipeline.

**Outcome:**
A stable backend skeleton capable of supporting large-scale features without restructuring.

   * Typography
   * Buttons
   * Forms
   * Alerts
3. Define UX rules:

   * Minimal clicks
   * Clear feedback on actions
   * No blocking UI during API calls
4. Implement loading states, skeleton screens, and graceful error messages.

A fast, intuitive discovery experience that reduces user friction.

---

# **PHASE 7: CART & SESSION MANAGEMENT**

## **Objective**

Allow users to manage shopping intent seamlessly and reliably.

**Outcome:**
A reliable cart system that minimizes abandonment and errors.

---

# **PHASE 8: CHECKOUT & ORDER CREATION**

## **Objective**

Transition user intent into structured, traceable orders.

If you want, next I can:

* Convert this into **a real academic thesis format**
* Turn each phase into **actual Django tasks + code**
* Create **ER diagrams and API maps**
* Or start **Phase 1 implementation line-by-line**

Just tell me how you want to proceed.
